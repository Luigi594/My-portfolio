              Hello again, I'm Luis Mart√≠nez and I'm getting close to become a Computer
              Science Engineer. I figured out my passion to the career when I was on 
              highschool, my last year was definitely my call, because it has made think 
              of what can be created by using technology and how is helping the entire
              world. And it's not just programming after all, is to create solutions 
              that's what I've liked the more.

              <br /> <br />

              Lately, since 2021 year, I've been pushing myself to learn more beyond my clasess, 
              to improve knowledge, to challenge me, by watching tutorials, reading blogs, and
              all has been to be able to write better code and to understand how could I apply those concepts on a 
              real-world scenario. My focus these days is to get prepare myself to create digital solutions
              for the users and give them the better experience.
