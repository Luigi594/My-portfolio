            Hello again, I'm Luis Mart√≠nez and I'm getting close to become a
            Computer Science Engineer. I figured out my passion to the career
            when I was on highschool, during my last year, because I realized
            how techonology has helped the world by creating amazing, successful
            and useful tools for every working field.
            <br /> <br />
            Since 2021 year, I've been pushing myself to learn more beyond my
            clasess, to improve knowledge, try to challenge me; by watching
            video tutorials, reading blogs, which has resulted in improved
            coding skills and better understanding of their applications in a
            real world scenario. My goal is to prepare myself to build reliable
            applications and provide the users the best experience.
