              Hello again, I'm Luis Mart√≠nez and I'm getting close to become a Computer
              Science Engineer. I figured out my passion to the career when I was on 
              highschool, during my last year, because I realized how techonology has helped
              the world by creating amazing, successful and useful tools for every
              working field.

              <br /> <br />

              Since 2021 year, I've been pushing myself to learn more beyond my clasess, 
              to improve knowledge, try to challenge me; by watching video tutorials, reading blogs, 
              which has resulted in improved coding skills and better understanding of their
              applications in a real world scenario. My goal is to prepare myself to build reliable 
              applications and provide the users the best experience.
